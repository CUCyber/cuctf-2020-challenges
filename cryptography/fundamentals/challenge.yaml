  XOR is a bitwise operator which returns 0 if the bits are the same, and 1 otherwise. One of the fundamentals of cyptography is the power of XOR.

  With this logic, a string of text can be encrypted by applying the bitwise XOR operator to every character using a given key. To decrypt the output, merely reapplying the XOR function with the key will remove the cipher.
