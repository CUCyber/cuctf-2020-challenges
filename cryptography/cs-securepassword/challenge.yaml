    Madd Hacker zipped some data before exfiltrating it from the database server. Unfortunately, loot.zip is password protected. Can you determine what was stolen?

    Here are some logs and a copy of securepassword.c if they help:

flag:
  file: ./flag.txt

provide:
- ./loot.zip
- ./securepassword.c
- ./syslog.txt
