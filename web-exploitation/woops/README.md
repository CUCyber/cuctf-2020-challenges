## Writeup:
1. The login pages takes any credentials as long as the username is not `admin`.  
2. After logging in, navigate to the `Who we are` tab then click `learn more` to visit the `/generic` page.  
3.  Visit the `settings` tab and view the source for the page.  
4.  At the botttom of the source you'll see this script which gets the user info:  
```javascript
<script>
    let user = document.getElementById("username-settings");
    let password = document.getElementById("pass-settings");
    fetch("/user_info55?username=sadf")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        user.innerText = "Username: " + data.username;
        password.innerText = "Password: " + data.password;
    });

</script>
```
5. Making a request to `/user_info55?username=admin` will return the credentials for the admin user.  
6. After logging into the `admin` user the flag will be displayed.
